#Final Project - Band Name Generator

# 1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")

#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in and store it in a variable.
city = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in?\n")

# Ask the user for the name of a pet and store it in a variable.
pet = input("what's your pet's name?\n")

# Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
band_name = city + " " + pet

print("Your band name could be " + band_name)

# Extra: Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line!
